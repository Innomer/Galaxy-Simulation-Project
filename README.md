# ðŸŒŒ Galaxy Collision Simulation (CUDA)

This project simulates the gravitational interaction between multiple galaxies in 3D space using **CUDA** for high-performance parallel computation. Each galaxy contains a supermassive black hole and thousands of orbiting stars, forming realistic spiral structures that interact over time.

## Features

- **N-body simulation** of gravitational forces using Newtonian physics
- **CUDA acceleration** for massive parallel computation
- Spiral galaxy generation with stable orbital mechanics
- Support for **multiple galaxies** and customizable parameters
- Saves simulation states every few steps as `.csv` for visualization
- Generates Python file to visualize using Matplotlib
- Simulates galaxy mergers and dynamic black hole interactions

## Demo

Available as .mp4 in the repository

## Physics Overview

The simulation uses:
- Newton's Law of Gravitation with softening to prevent singularities.
- Leapfrog integration for stable and energy-conserving time evolution.
- Velocity initialization based on circular orbits around black holes.
